**United States:**
In July 2024, the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, with the number of unemployed individuals increasing by 352,000 to 7.2 million. This is higher compared to the same time last year, when the jobless rate was 3.5%. Key sectors such as healthcare, construction, and transportation saw job growth, while the information sector experienced job losses. The number of people working part-time due to economic reasons also rose, indicating some challenges in finding full-time employment【31†source】.

**San Antonio, Texas:**
In the San Antonio-New Braunfels metropolitan area, the unemployment rate increased to 4.2% in June 2024, up from 3.5% in May. The local labor force saw a significant increase in individuals seeking employment, with notable job gains in sectors like private education, health services, construction, and manufacturing. However, job losses were noted in trade, transportation, utilities, professional services, and government sectors【32†source】.

**Overall Job Market Outlook:**
Nationally, job growth has been slower than expected, with 114,000 new jobs added in July, below the monthly average of the previous year. This sluggish growth has led to concerns about potential economic slowdown, though there are no immediate signs of a recession【31†source】【32†source】.

These insights highlight the nuanced picture of the current job market, with specific regional and sectoral variations influencing the overall employment landscape.; } <!--UNIVERSAL ELEMENT-->
